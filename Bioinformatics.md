# Portfolio: Bioinformatics Online Tutorial
<p>■ <b>Project Title:</b> <a href="https://www.kelleybioinfo.org/index.php" target="_blank">Kelley Bioinformatics</a><br></p>
<p>■ <b>Project Introduction:</b> This website provides tutorials of some of the algorithms in Bioinformatics for manipulating DNA sequences.  
This was done in collaboration with Dr. Scott Kelley, Director of the Bioinformatics Department at San Diego State University. The 
  accompanying book is available at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Computational-Biology-Hypertextbook-ASM-Books-ebook&crid=1ORJPCRK8AQW&sprefix=https+%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fcomputational-biology-hypertextbook-asm-books-ebook%2Caps%2C329&ref=nb_sb_noss" target="_blank">
  Amazon</a>.</p>
■ <b>Modeling and Evaluation:</b> The project was written in PHP and Python.  It renders the output via HTML scripts.<br>
Tutorials are available for 16 algorithms used in Bioinformatics:
<table>

■ <b>Conclusion:</b> Kelley Bioinformatics is a freely available, comprehensive introductory bioinformatics education platform. 
  This site leverages the speed and accessibility of the internet with the interactive nature of mobile devices to help students 
  learn introductory bioinformatics theory (algorithms) and practice (online bioinformatics tools.) 
  The website is updated on a regular basis and there is also a companion textbook published by Wiley press.
